	<h2> But, There is still one issue that plagued us over the past few years... </h2>
	<h3> Climate Change </h3>
	<p> A danger to our continued existense. Due to our reckless abandon in destroying our planet, we created a problem too dangerous to let it continue. Making factories powered by crude oil, cutting down trees that house animals, and polluting the land and water with trash and the air with poisonous smog. We should have acted sooner, but we failed to do such a thing, and for that we must act now and try and save our planet.

	<p> Yet, theres still hope! There are many organizations out there trying their best to find solutions to these wide amount of issues surronding climate change. There are people studying effective power sources, materials, and ways to combat the amount of crude oil we still use today. Although it will take time, it clearly shows that if we take action now, we can make up for the mistakes we made yesterday. Hopefully this will inspire you to do the same. </p>
